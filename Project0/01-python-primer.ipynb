    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a data type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type is a classification of data that tells the computer how to interpret the data. Different data types store data in different ways. For example, the data type `int` stores integers, while the data type `str` stores strings. The computer interprets the data differently depending on the data type. For example, the computer interprets the data type `int` as a number, while it interprets the data type `str` as a string of characters. The way that the computer stores and interprets data is important because it determines how the computer will perform operations on the data. Ultimately, the data type determines what the data is and what can be done with it. They are often related to mathematical concepts like numbers, sets, and algebraic structures. Some languages also have special types that can represent nothingness or the absence of a value such as `None` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of built-in data types. The most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`: integers\n",
    "- `float`: floating point numbers\n",
    "- `str`: strings\n",
    "- `bool`: boolean values\n",
    "- `list`: ordered collection of objects\n",
    "- `tuple`: ordered, immutable collection of objects\n",
    "- `dict`: unordered collection of key-value pairs\n",
    "- `set`: unordered collection of unique objects\n",
    "- `NoneType`: special and has one value, `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles datatypes in an interesting way. Everything in Python is an object and every object in Python has a type. This abstraction offers the language the ability to loosely define variables. This means that variables are not declared with a type, but rather they are assigned a type when a value is assigned to them. This also means that variables can change type if a new value is assigned to them. Handling data in this way allows for a lot of flexibility, but it can also be confusing at times. This is an example of a dynamically typed or weakly typed language. Other languages, such as C, are statically typed, meaning that variables are declared with a type and cannot change type. They are also strongly typed, meaning that the type of a variable is enforced and cannot be changed."

    "\n",
    "Like many programming languages, Python has a number of built-in container types. These are data structures that hold other objects. The most common ones are:\n",
