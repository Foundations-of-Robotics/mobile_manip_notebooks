    "In computer science, a terminal is a program that allows the user to access the computer's command-line interface (CLI). Using a terminal, the user can run programs on a computer without a graphical user interface (GUI). An example of a terminal program is the Windows Command Prompt, which provides access to the Windows CLI. Another example is the Bash shell, which is the default terminal program on most Linux distributions.\n",

    "A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for a Unix-like operating system. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console (i.e., an all-text display mode) or terminal window (an all-text window) and then execute (i.e., run) them. The shell's main job is to start other programs, such as the Bash shell, which is the default shell on most Linux distributions.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> A file system is a method of organizing and storing files on a computer. It is a hierarchy of directories (also referred to as folders) and files. The file system is responsible for managing the storage of files and directories on a computer's hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD).\n",

    "> These days cloud based filesystems obscure the files and folders in a way that makes it difficult to understand the underlying structure. However, filesystems are still important to understand because they are the foundation of how computers store and organize data.\n",
