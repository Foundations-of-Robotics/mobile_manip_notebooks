# Project 2: Localization and Kalman Filters

## Files details

### CSV-Analyse

Notebook to extract the variance from the encoders_data.csv and imu_data.csv files.

### FK-Analyse

Notebook to compare the Kalman filter performance with the ground truth.

### Project2_1

Notebook to estimate the robot's movements using the encoders.

### Project2_2

Notebook to design and test a Kalman filter. Different solutions for 3, 4 and 6 states are available in addition to an extented Kalman filter.
